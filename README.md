# Refactoring Code

**The reason for this project was to make the website more accessible without compramising the CSS codes.**

**I've notice that the orginial html had a lot of div's. My goal was to change all the div's 
Semantic Elements. Such as,**

* **Header**
* **Nav**
* **Section**
* **Summary**
* **Footer**

_This allowed the coding to be much cleaner and allows any other developer understand what is being coded._

This is a great resourse for Semantic Elements: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

## CSS Styles

**I also noticed in css styles that a lot of the coding was repeative.
I was able to condience certian sections with the same style into one code.**
